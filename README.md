I like D&D, volleyball, beer & brewing, music, cooking & good food.
I live in the Washington, DC area.  I went to High School in York, PA.  College in Boston, MA.  Grad school in San Antonio, TX.
I know the Interactive Data Language very well.  I'm learning Python.  There are a bunch of other coding languages I would like to learn as well.
